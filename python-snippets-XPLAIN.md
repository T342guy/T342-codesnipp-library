# python snippets Xplain/

my requirements for python snippets:

1. make the python file able to run the code straight./
if dependencies are required to be installed, list all of them in the SNIPPET-Xplain.md file./
as well, if wanted, add a requirements.txt file for others convenience.

2. in the python snippet, make a link to the SNIPPET-xplain.md file and the requirements.txt file./
with minimal, but useful notes inside the code.

3. in the SNIPPET-Xplain.md file, try your best to Xplain the code! (see what I did there hehe)/ 
I(as me, T3) will sometimes be wrong, or just make it confusing. if you want I will 100% accept guidance, as I still don't know a lot haha
